# DRSE
"DRSE" is Really Simple Editor that can make step like DanceRush Stardom.

The focus was on the Making and Playing of steps rather than game function.

한국어 설명은 여기로 -> <https://github.com/BoredSomeone/DRSE/blob/master/README_Korean.md>

### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to create and play steps that are similar to Dancerush Stardom.

I wish it could play real game, but this is not a priority.

### Progress of project
It is an unfinished project. so, it can be a variety of bugs, and no built version yet.

### Environment of project
Unity 2021.3.11f1

#### The following features are currently completed:
* Load & Save Steps
* Play, Pause, Play at a specific point

#### The following features are currently planned:
* Multilingual support (Currently planned in Korean and English. Currently, only Korean is written.)
* Add shortcut
* Start delay (change the position of the all steps. Like adjusting sync)
* Start Timer (Press Start to Wait and Start)
* Create New project (Load Music)
* Notification in exception
* More awesome UI and images
* Change speed function (In effort)
* Video output function (BGA, Step effect, etc.)
* Can play real games (Just thinking)


## etc.
I'm not used to git and Unity yet, so many mistakes and problems can occur. If you write issue, I'll try my best.

I'm not good at English, so there are many comments in Korean. And there will be many mistakes in README & Code. Please excuse me.
